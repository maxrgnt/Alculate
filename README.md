# Alculate
## The only iOS app that helps you buzz smarter.

[Available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alculate/id1480777005)

Alculate started as a tool to determine and compare the various types of alcohol types/sizes found in stores and restaurants. From there a BAC estimator tool was developed using the [Widmark formula](https://www.google.com/search?q=widmark+formula&oq=widmark+formula&aqs=chrome.0.0l8.3298j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

After months of developing a robust BAC% tracker it was determined Alculate's BAC% estimation feature lacked the appropriate validation associated with hardware-based medical analysis despite the use of Widmark's formula in forensic alcohol analysis.

The final iteration of Alculate focuses on converting various forms of alcohol a user may encounter into digestible shot-based metrics by discerning the "Highest Value" and "Most Effective" forms of alcohol.
